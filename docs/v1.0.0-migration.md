# v1.0.0 migration

This major release involves migrating all custom webpack configs to Next.js, as it eases the burden
of maintenance, at the cost of some flexibility by following Next.js file structures, which can be
a good thing.

With the introduction of Next.js, this application now supports static site generation and server side
rendering by default. Creating a custom SSR webpack config is a huge hassle, as it involves maintaining
two separate webpack configs, one for the server and one for the client, as well as making sure all imported
libraries are isomorphic (e.g. fetch). Some webpack loaders are made redundant like style-loader as the DOM is not
availble. Plugins like MiniCSSExtractPlugin does not work, as well as HtmlWebpackPlugin because the server
is now returning the rendered HTML.

Pre v1.0.0 code splits the bundle into two separate bundles, one for the application, and one for the vendor. Next.js
has a more advanced code splitting algorithm that is far more production-ready and is researched by well supported
developers.

Polyfills used to be manually handled by importing what is only neccessarily in polyfill.js, the biggest pain is
maintaining what is needed in corejs@3 (even though you only need to do this once). Next.js helps ease the burden and 
allows us to focus on the application problem, as well as being setup to only import the polyfills only when the legacy
browser needs it.
We can extend upon their polyfills, but make sure we do not duplicate what they have by having a look at their
[polyfill lists](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next-polyfill-nomodule/src/index.js).

We let the logic of transpiling by relying on @babel/preset-env over to Next.js.

Our custom webpack configs however are still inside /config and are not removed. Some of the partials are still being used, especially
for React storybook and Next.js custom webpack config. One such example is the support of inline SVG. Next.js do not support inline
SVG by default, but it has the advantage over normal SVG files by reducing the number of HTTP requests. We can also modify
inline SVG more easily via `fill` or `stroke`. Next.js allows us to import images straight from the `<img src={}>` tags, the base
folder for all these images are inside /public. Inline SVG however, are not. As of now, if you want to import inline SVG,
you may have to put these svgs next to the file that imports it.

## What is changed

- Move all component related files to /components
- Move all high level components to /pages
- Polyfill.js is removed, if there is an unsupported polyfill that you need, have a look at
  [how to add custom polyfill to next.config.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/blob/canary/examples/with-polyfills/next.config.js).
- Removed all `import React from 'react'` and ReactDOM code, as Next.js handles that for us.
- Removed `index.ejs` template, as our template is not served on the server side. If you for some reason, needs a custom client
  rendered app, you can bring it back by looking at git history, and use the `html` partial in /config.
- All global CSS imports are not allowed anymore, and that includes `:root`. All global CSS variables are now in /styles.
- All CSS modules are now renamed to `*.module.scss` because Next.js needs it to be like that.
- All images and assets are now in /public.
- Anything global that needs to be imported can be done so in `pages/_app.tsx`.
